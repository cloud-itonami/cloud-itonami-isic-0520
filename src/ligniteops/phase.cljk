  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-0520 lignite-mining
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-production  -- production-record logging
                                     allowed, every write needs human
                                     approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination -- adds maintenance scheduling and
                                     shipment coordination writes,
                                     still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                     `:log-production-record`/
                                     `:schedule-maintenance`/
                                     `:coordinate-shipment` may
                                     auto-commit. `:flag-safety-
                                     concern` NEVER auto-commits, at
                                     any phase.

  `:flag-safety-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Surfacing a safety concern always
  needs a human to actually look at it. `ligniteops.governor`'s own
  `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same invariant independently --
  two layers, not one, agree on this."
